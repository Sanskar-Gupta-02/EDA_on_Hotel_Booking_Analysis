# Hotel-Booking-Analysis
In recent decades, the travel and tourism industry has seen substantial profit growth, with a rising number of people enjoying better lifestyles and resources for travel. The hotel business, while lucrative, is also highly volatile, dependent on factors like hotel type, business seasons, customer segments, booking methods, amenities, and services. This project aims to conduct thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on guest data, hotel types, booking and pricing trends, distribution channels, and more to extract insights for informed business decisions.
